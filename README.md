Advisor: Prof. Yao-Min Chiang (Apr. 2021 â€“ Jun. 2021)
Applied Fama-Macbeth regression to Taiwan stock market to empirically test which factors are important in explaining the expected stock returns in Taiwan.

1. Performed Fama-Macbeth regression to show that firm size can robustly and significantly explain the expected returns in Taiwan stock market with a negative relationship, and both market factor and book-to-market ratio are not statistically significant under 0.05 significance level.
2. Analyzed market data and perceived that there might exist heterogeneous behaviors on factors explaining expected returns among industries in a single market.
